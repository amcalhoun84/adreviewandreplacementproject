Advertisement/Brand Detector | CSCI 576 Multimedia Project | Instructor: Parag Havaldar | Demo date: May 2022

This project was built under extreme constraints — two weeks, while I was doing a graduate capstone, with a team of non-professionals. It’s rough around the edges, but it demonstrates how I can deliver under pressure. More importantly, looking back with senior-level experience, I can clearly see where I’d improve it: modularizing the pipeline, introducing configuration, building in observability, and creating test harnesses. That reflection shows how I’ve grown from being able to ‘get it working’ to knowing how to make it maintainable and scalable.
